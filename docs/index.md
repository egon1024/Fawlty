Library for interacting with a SensuGo server.

## Overview

This library was born of a desire to be able to more directly and easily interface with a [SenguGo](https://sensu.io/) server.  It is written to cover the use cases that I personally need, but I am open to requests and (especially) pull requests to cover features beyond my own needs.
